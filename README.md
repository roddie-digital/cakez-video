# Cakez video URL shortener

Easy way to reference Twitch clips (and YouTube videos) since native clip management and discoverability is so poor.

The GitHub repo is linked to a [Netlify](https://netlify.com) site leveraging their `_redirects` file - [Syntax for the `_redirects` file](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-redirects-file) available in their documentation:

> ### Syntax for the `_redirects` file
>
> In a `_redirects` file, each redirect rule must be listed on a separate line, with the original path followed by the new path or URL. Any line beginning with `#` will be ignored as a comment.
>
> You can customize and alter the redirect behavior by adding options to the end of each line such as HTTP status code, country conditions, or language conditions. Visit the [redirect options](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/) doc for more details on these and other configuration options including query parameters, domain-level redirects, and more. You can also use redirects for [rewrites and proxies](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/).
